Worst-Case Runtime Analysis

Task0: O(1)
(Getting items from a known position in a list is done in constant time)

Task1: O(n)
(Needed to iterate over the lists of entries in the phone and text logs)

Task2: O(n)
(Needed to iterate over the lists of entries in the phone logs)

Task3: O(n*log(n)):
(Needed to sort the output - I used Python's sorted function)

Task4: O(n*log(n)):
(Needed to sort the output - I used Python's sorted function)
